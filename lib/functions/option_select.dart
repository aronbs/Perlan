/*
Create a function called OptionSelect which takes in a list of options,
prints them out to the user and asks for the user to select an option.

It should then print something like

List<String> options = ['BurgerKing', 'McDonalds'];
int idx = OptionSelect('Where do you want to eat?', options );
and returns the users answer.

Where do you want to eat?
[1] BurgerKing
[2] McDonalds
Bonus point!
Can you make it so that if the user does not select a correct option,
that the function will simply ask the user again to input an answer?
